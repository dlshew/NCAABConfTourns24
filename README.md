For conference tournaments I decided to take some basic stats and apply a few different models to them and see if anything interesting comes out. There’s going to be a decent amount here so, I’m going to break it into 6 parts. The first one will be explaining the process and cleaning the data. The second will be a casual look at the data and some basic charts. The third will be some basic regression with the Julia GLM package. The fourth is decision trees and random forest classifiers with the Julia MLJ package. The fifth will be a deep learning model using the Julia Lux package. The 6th will be some predictions and model comparisons.
The first part is going to be mostly skippable unless you want to see a data cleaning process but unless your into that kind of stuff its pretty boring. The rest of them you can jump around as you want really. What parts your interested in will depend on personal preference, some people will want predictions, some will want to see the charts and results to make their own, and other people will want the code. Generally I’m going to try and put as little as code as possible into the writing but I will put some just to show some of the process. The rest will all be available here.
 I made a couple choices that may hurt the predictions but makes getting the data easier. I decided to use only use stats available at BartTorvik.com because you can get preconferecne tournament data without any web scrapping and its free if anyone wants to try and replicate this or do anything else like it. Torvik has a site Adam wi’s where he ask you to please not scrape his site and there’s a lot of info on there on how to get data. For all the most part I just went to the part of his site I wanted and added CSV=1 to the url. The issue with this approach is the data came back pretty ugly without column names or conferences. This meant a decent amount of cleaning. You can see everything I did here. I went over the top and made like a 40 CSV files were mostly only going to use 3 but since I was cleaning the data I figured I might want it split into different versions at some point.
There may ben issues with the data I tried checking it as much as I could but I’m not a professional programmer, I have a job that has nothing to do with this, and I’m kind of lazy. I also used old KenPom data I had to add the confenreces, which meant trying to match up team names, which I would say is the most likely thing I messed up. As a hobbyist programmer and putting myself up against the wall time wise doing this with tournaments starting on March 4th, some parts of the code are pretty ugly so any issues or advice is appreciated. That’s all I got for an into feel free to go to whatever part interest you the most whether thats part 1, 6, or code.
